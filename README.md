# Thanks

Thankyou to **Marfullsen**'s excellent [AOE2 Minimap Generator](https://github.com/Marfullsen/AoE2-minimap-generator), on which this script was based on. In the end much got rewritten, but it certainly served as the inspiration and a great starting point.

Of course thanks to **happyleaves**'s [aoc-mgz](https://github.com/happyleavesaoc/aoc-mgz), which is key in parsing AOE2's recorded games.
